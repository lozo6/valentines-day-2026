        <p class="letter-text">
          I love you very much. Every time I see you, whether it's through call
          or in-person, I get excited to see you. You are cute, quirky, and
          super funny. You are caring, loving, and very thoughtful. I love you
          so so much. I fall in love with you every day and I'm always excited
          to see you the next time we meet. Thank you for everything. I can't
          wait to have a fun future with you.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-signature">Love,</p>
